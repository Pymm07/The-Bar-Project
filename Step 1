Define the Problem:
Due to the recent snowstorms, solar panels have been getting covered. This causes them to generate less energy. We need to create a solution that can remove the snow and debris from the panels.

Criteria:
1. It has to be automated.
2. It has to last the life of the solar panel.
3. It has to be reusable.

Constraints:
1. Money / limited budget
2. Time (until the end of Semester 2; 80 minutes a day)
3. Material availability
